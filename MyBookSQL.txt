However, limited educational materials exist in this field. "Introduction to Computational Science" fills this void with a flexible, readable textbook that assumes only a background in high school algebra and enables instructors to follow tailored pathways through the material. It is the first textbook designed specifically for an introductory course in the computational science and engineering curriculum. The text embraces two major approaches to computational science problems: System dynamics models with their global views of major systems that change with time; and cellular automaton simulations with their local views of how individuals affect individuals. While the text is generic, an extensive author-generated Web-site contains tutorials and files in a variety of software packages to accompany the text.Generic software approach in the text Web site with tutorials and files in a variety of software packages Engaging examples, exercises, and projects that explore science Additional, substantial projects for students to develop individually or in teams Consistent application of the modeling process Quick review questions and answers Projects for students to develop individually or in teams Reference sections for most modules, as well as a glossary Online instructor"s manual with a test bank and solutions','IntroductiontoComputationalScience.jpg','IntroductiontoComputationalScience.html','11-AUG-2015','1');

The text provides a clear and easily understandable discussion of logic circuit design without the use of unnecessary formalism. It emphasizes the synthesis of circuits and explains how circuits are implemented in real chips. Fundamental concepts are illustrated by using small examples, which are easy to understand. Then, a modular approach is used to show how larger circuits are designed. VHDL is a complex language so it is introduced gradually in the book. Each VHDL feature is presented as it becomes pertinent for the circuits being discussed. While it includes a discussion of VHDL, the book provides thorough coverage of the fundamental concepts of logic circuit design, independent of the use of VHDL and CAD tools. A CD-ROM containg all of the VHDL design examples used in the book, as well Altera"s Quartus II CAD software, is included free with every text.','FundamentalsofDigitalLogicwithVHDLDesign.jpg','FundamentalsofDigitalLogicwithVHDLDesign.html','19-MAY-2015','0');
